# Laptop Magic Hub

## About Project:
This _react_ project is integrated with _node.js_ to make it medium level _full-stack_ website. On this client side I have used **React Router**, **private route** for making it authentic. It needs **google sign in** credentials for buying any products. Basically this website is for purchasing laptops of some brands. And finally after **checkout** your order will be confirmed by your email address and order page will provide you with your **order information** which is hide from other users. Again there is an admin panel from where user can **add products** for this website and **delete** from the website. These whole things are connected through **mongodb, firebase, github and heroku**.
